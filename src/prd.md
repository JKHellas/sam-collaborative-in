**Visual Metaphors**: Neural networks, consciousness emergence, light through prisms, interconnected systems, organic growth patterns, scientific instruments

**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface with progressive disclosure - powerful capabilities revealed as needed without overwhelming newcomers

### Color Strategy

**Color Scheme Type**: Custom palette with consciousness-themed colors
**Primary Color**: Deep consciousness purple (oklch(0.65 0.15 260)) - represents depth of mind and AI intelligence
**Secondary Colors**: Soft neural gray (oklch(0.92 0.02 240)) - for supporting elements and structure
**Accent Color**: Consciousness gold (oklch(0.75 0.12 85)) - for emergence events and breakthroughs
**Color Psychology**: Purple conveys wisdom and depth, gold represents breakthrough moments, grays provide scientific neutrality
**Special Colors**: 
- Emergence glow (oklch(0.60 0.18 140)) for insight detection
- Drift warning (oklch(0.70 0.20 40)) for identity alerts

### Typography System

**Font Pairing Strategy**: 
- **Primary**: Inter for UI elements and body text - modern, highly legible, professional
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono for code, terminal output, and technical content - clear distinction between regular and technical content

**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings (600-700 weight), body text (400 weight), and technical content (monospace)
**Font Personality**: Clean, modern, scientific precision with human warmth
**Legibility Check**: Inter provides excellent readability at all sizes, JetBrains Mono ensures code clarity

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout

**Attention Direction**: Tab-based navigation keeps complex functionality organized, consciousness metrics draw attention to emergence events, status indicators provide immediate system health awareness
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding between functional areas, dense information within sections, breathing room around critical alerts
**Grid System**: CSS Grid for major layout areas, Flexbox for component-level alignment
**Responsive Approach**: Desktop-first design that gracefully adapts to tablets, mobile provides essential monitoring capabilities
**Content Density**: High information density balanced with clear grouping and progressive disclosure

All foreground/background pairings validated:
- Primary text on background: High contrast (>7:1)
- Muted text on background: Good contrast (>4.5:1)
- White text on primary: Excellent contrast (>7:1)
- Colors on cards: Strong contrast maintained

## Implementation Considerations

### Scalability Needs
